# movie-classifier

## Challenge Goal

Develop a predictive model that analyzes movie synopses and assigns appropriate genres. The challenge is to achieve high prediction accuracy and ensure the quality and efficiency of your code.

## Evaluation Criteria

Machine Learning Model Performance: Mean Average Precision at K for the top 5 predicted genres. Note that this metric keeps the ranking into account.

## Dataset

The dataset includes movie synopses with corresponding genres, split into training and test sets. The training set is for model development, and the test set evaluates your model's performance.
